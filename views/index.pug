		**SwiftCash Explorer** is [open-source](https://github.com/swiftcashproject/rpc-explorer). If you run your own [SwiftCash Full Node](https://wallets.swiftcash.cc/), **SwiftCash Explorer** can easily run alongside it, communicating via RPC calls. See the project [ReadMe](https://github.com/swiftcashproject/rpc-explorer) for a list of features and instructions for running.
